    update_packages(): Upgrade all installed Python packages to their latest version.

    This function uses the pip package manager to get a list of installed packages and their versions.
    It then loops through each package, attempts to upgrade it to the latest version, and captures any error output.
    A progress bar is displayed to track the update process.

    Returns:
    None.

    Raises:
    None.
